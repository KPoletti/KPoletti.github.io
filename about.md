## About Me

:wave: Hi, I'm Keith Poletti, a data scientist, ML researcher, and grad student.
I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics at UT Austin and I am advised 
by [Dr. Stella S. R. Offner](https://sites.google.com/view/stellaoffner/home) and [Dr. Rachel A. Ward](https://sites.google.com/prod/view/rward/home).

My research interests include Scientific Machine Learning, Uncertainty Quantification, and Bayesian Inference. 
At the moment, I am working on developing neural operators for solving partial differential equations and inverse problems in astrophysics.

## Personal
In my free time, I enjoy climbing, running, and film photography. When I am not doing one of those things, I am probably listening to an album or watching a movie.
