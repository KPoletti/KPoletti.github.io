:wave:&nbsp; Hi, I'm {{ site.author.name }},a data scientist, ML researcher, and grad student.
I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Computational, Science, Engineering, and Mathematics at the UT Austin and I am advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/stellaoffner/home" > Dr. Stella S. R. Offner</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/prod/view/rward/home"> Dr. Rachel A. Ward.</a>
My research insterests include Scientific Machine Learning, Uncertainty Quantification, and Bayesian Inference. At the moment, I am working on developing neural operators for solving partial differential equations and inverse problems in astrophysics.

In my free time, I enjoy climbing, running, and film photography. When I am not doing one of those things, I am probably listening to an album or watching a movie.
